# Lyrionster

Play the [Hitster game](https://hitstergame.com) on your [Lyrion](https://lyrion.org)-connected player. This plugin makes use of the Spotify integration in LMS.

The app side of the plugin is based on [SongSeeker](https://github.com/andygruber/songseeker) by [andygruber](https://github.com/andygruber). 

## Compatible games

- Hitster Original Deutsch
- Hitster Original Nederlands

## TODO

- Better name
- Add security to plugin endpoint
- Make the app launch better from the LMS menu
- Create dropdown to select player
- Do something about the styling
- Add csv lists for other language Hitster games
- CSV is now served with html extension as csv does not work
- Add support for Tidal/Qobuz (this means that for every song a Tidal/Qobuz URL needs to be added to the csv)
